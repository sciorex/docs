# Getting Started

Welcome to **Sciorex** — The King of Knowledge! 👑

Sciorex is a powerful desktop application for orchestrating AI agent swarms, designing research workflows, and managing everything with an intuitive Kanban interface.

## What is Sciorex?

Sciorex is your **AI-powered companion** that works alongside your favorite IDE. It's not a replacement for VS Code, Cursor, or any other editor — it's the **command center** where AI agents do the heavy lifting while you stay in control.

**How it works:** You use Sciorex to orchestrate AI agents that can read, write, and edit files in your codebase. The agents implement features, fix bugs, and refactor code. Then you review the changes and continue working in your IDE as usual.

### Who is Sciorex for?

- **Developers** — Agents implement features, fix bugs, and refactor code. You review and ship.
- **Researchers** — Build pipelines for paper fetching, summarization, and knowledge synthesis.
- **Teams** — Track work with tickets. Link AI sessions so everyone sees what agents did.
- **Writers** — Chain agents for drafting, editing, fact-checking, and formatting.
- **Data analysts** — Explore datasets and build analysis pipelines.
- **Students** — Research topics and learn with personalized AI tutors.
- **Consultants** — Automate client research and report generation.
- **Journalists** — Investigate stories, cross-reference facts, uncover connections.
- **You** — Whatever your workflow, Sciorex adapts.

With Sciorex, you can:

- 🤖 **Create specialized AI agents** with custom prompts and tool permissions
- ✏️ **Let agents edit your code** — they can create, modify, and refactor files
- 🔀 **Design visual workflows** to chain multiple agents together
- 📋 **Track tasks** with an integrated ticket/Kanban system
- 🔬 **Build automated pipelines** for research, code review, and more
- 🔌 **Extend capabilities** with MCP tools and custom integrations
