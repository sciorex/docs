# Activity Feed

The Activity view shows a chronological feed of everything happening in your workspace. It's your central log for tracking what you, your agents, and your flows have been doing.

## Accessing Activity

Click **Activity** in the sidebar or press `Ctrl+8` to open the Activity view.

## What's Tracked

The Activity feed captures:

| Event Type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| **Ticket events** | Created, status changed, assigned, completed |
| **Session events** | Chat started, agent run completed, session archived |
| **Flow events** | Flow started, node completed, flow finished |
| **Agent events** | Agent created, agent modified |
| **File events** | Files created, edited, deleted by agents |

## Activity Entry Format

Each entry shows:

- **Icon** indicating the event type
- **Description** of what happened
- **Timestamp** (relative time like "5 minutes ago")
- **Actor** who performed the action (you, an agent, or system)
- **Link** to the related item (ticket, session, etc.)

## Filtering

Filter the activity feed by:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Type** | All, Tickets, Sessions, Flows, Agents |
| **Time** | Today, This Week, This Month, All Time |
| **Actor** | All, User, Agents, System |

## Use Cases

**Track agent work**: See what your agents have been doing, which files they modified, and what decisions they made.

**Audit trail**: Review the history of a project to understand how it evolved.

**Debug issues**: Find when something changed to help troubleshoot problems.

**Team awareness**: In shared workspaces, see what others have been working on.

## Linked Items

Click any linked item in an activity entry to navigate to it:

- Ticket references open the ticket detail panel
- Session references open the chat or agent run
- Flow references open the flow editor or execution view

## Refresh

The activity feed updates in real-time as new events occur. You can also manually refresh to ensure you have the latest data.
